    <p>
		HTML or <span class="def">HyperText Markup Language</span> is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets, within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs and, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lsaquo;img&rsaquo;.
	</p>
	<p>	
		The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). In between these tags web designers can add text, further tags, comments and other types of text-based content.
	</p>	
    <p>
    	The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.
    </p>
    <p>	
    	HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. It is the code behind your webpage and is what your browser looks for to display a webpage, the way the webdesigner intended it to look, and is a series of tags that tells the browser where to display what. It is really a series of simple commands that you give to the browser, just like telling your dog to sit, and because it is in plain English it is easy to learn.
    </p>
    <p>	
    	Web browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the appearance and layout of text and other material. The W3C, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML. After you've started learning HTML, you will find that it is a very flexible language. You can build web pages that do many different things.There are web pages on almost anything you can think of. Your only limit is your imagination. And they are all written in HTML.
